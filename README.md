# Dyanmic Adaptive Spatio-temporal GCN for fMRI modelling (DAST-GCN)

This is the original pytorch implementation of DAST-GCN  in the paper [Dynamic Adaptive Spatio-temporal Graph Convolution for fMRI Modelling] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12517)

## Requirements
- python 3
- see `requirements.txt`

## Data Preparation
See dataframe samples at csvfiles

## Infered Graph Visulizations

Infered graph after training for both tasks on ukbb. 'The graph was restricted to static configuration ('1 adaptive grah structure for all blocks') for more robust visulizations'
